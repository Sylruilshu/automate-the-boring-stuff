Use the readlines() File object method to return a list of strings, 
one string per line in the file. For the first file, 
output the first line to column 1, row 1. 
The second line should be written to column 1, row 2, and so on. 
The next file that is read with readlines() will be written to column 2, 
the next file to column 3, and so on.
